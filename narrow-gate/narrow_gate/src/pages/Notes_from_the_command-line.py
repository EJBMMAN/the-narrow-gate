Hello world!

You may recognize it as one of the first, if not the first, things that any programmer gets to have their code output. Using "Hello world!" as a simple test program has been a tradition going back all the way back to the 70's. For anyone first starting out programming seeing ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù print out on a terminal is quite a brilliant moment. Usually this moment is preceded by a lot of groping about in the dark, trying to figure out how to install things, how to navigate the terminal, fumbling syntax. Then all of a sudden the black terminal is illuminated by the while ‚Äúhello world!‚Äù text. It marks a moment of real hope. The stumbling in the dark was worth it, your work was not in vain. 

I wonder if this is how the Jews felt reading the nativity account in Matthew‚Äôs gospel going through Christ‚Äôs genealogy. For generations they waited for the messiah. Going through years of occupation and slavery. Finally, the Lord comes and a light pierces the darkness. I read the canticle of Zechariah and feel like I can get a sense of the toil and effort and struggle of keeping the covenant, and the sheer relief and joy he must have felt finally seeing the savior. The ‚Äúhello world‚Äù of the Lord truly is such. The word is made flesh and makes known to the world there is a God, and he is nearer than we think. He dwelt among us, and indeed he continues to be present for us to this day through His Church and most especially through the Holy Eucharist. 

But, it doesn‚Äôt stop at ‚Äúhello world‚Äù. For the programmer ‚Äúhello world‚Äù also represents the first steps of a journey. I see many things in my life, including programming and spirituality, as part of a journey. I spend my days wandering about working and struggling for things I hope for. Step by step, making little mistakes and learning from them, and living little breakthrough to little breakthrough of grace. Everyday hoping for the good that is to come, trusting that the journey and the labor is not in vain. The process is reminder that my hope is in Christ. I‚Äôve built a little tool here on this site to help find Him where and when I can. I hope this also benefits you. I know that at least for myself I need to be with him to give me the strength to move forward. 

This blog is also on its first steps, and I hope to have you join us for the ride
